# Development Agents

This repository includes a set of development agents meant to streamline the contribution process using Codex. Each agent has a specific role and can be run together or individually depending on the task at hand.

## Available Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Lead Planner** | Breaks down features and creates a roadmap for implementation. |
| **Backend Developer** | Implements FastAPI endpoints and Python logic. |
| **Frontend Developer** | Works on the React/TypeScript codebase. |
| **QA Tester** | Executes unit tests and reports results. |
| **Docs Writer** | Updates project documentation and READMEs. |

## Starting Codex with the Development Agents

1. Install the `codex` CLI if you haven't already.
2. Set your OpenAI API key so the agents can function:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
3. Start Codex with the agent list:
   ```bash
   codex agents start LeadPlanner BackendDeveloper FrontendDeveloper QATester DocsWriter
   ```
   Adjust the command if your Codex setup uses a different syntax or configuration file.

## Example Workflows

### Backend Planning
1. Launch Codex with the **Lead Planner**.
2. Describe the feature you want to build.
3. The agent outputs a series of tasks which can then be assigned to the **Backend Developer**.

### Frontend Implementation
1. Start Codex with the **Frontend Developer**.
2. Provide the task description or use the plan generated by the planner.
3. The agent generates or modifies React/TypeScript files accordingly.

### Running Tests
1. Invoke the **QA Tester** agent.
2. The agent runs backend tests using `pytest` and frontend tests with `npm test`.
3. Review the results and iterate as needed.

These agents can collaborate, allowing you to plan, implement, and verify features more efficiently.
