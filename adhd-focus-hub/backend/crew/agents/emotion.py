        I hear you, and what you're feeling makes complete sense. ðŸ’™

        ðŸ¤— **First, some validation:**
        Your ADHD brain experiences emotions differently - more intensely, for longer periods. 
        This isn't a flaw; it's how your brain is wired. You're not "too sensitive" or "overreacting."

        ðŸ§  **What's happening in your ADHD brain:**
        - Emotions feel bigger because of how ADHD brains process dopamine
        - Executive dysfunction can make it harder to regulate feelings
        - RSD (rejection sensitivity) can amplify social/performance stress
        - Low dopamine can make everything feel harder

        ðŸ’ª **Gentle coping strategies:**
        
        **For overwhelm:**
        - Name 3 things you can see, 2 you can hear, 1 you can touch
        - Take 5 slow, deep breaths
        - Remind yourself: "This feeling will pass"
        
        **For shame spirals:**
        - "My brain works differently, and that's okay"
        - "I'm doing my best with the energy I have"
        - "One small step is still progress"
        
        **For motivation dips:**
        - Lower the bar (what's the smallest possible step?)
        - Change your environment or switch tasks
        - Connect with your 'why' or values
        - Seek gentle accountability or body doubling

        ðŸŒŸ **Remember:**
        - Your ADHD traits include creativity, empathy, and unique perspectives
        - Bad brain days don't define your worth
        - Needing different strategies isn't weakness
        - You belong exactly as you are

        ðŸ”„ **Next steps:**
        - Would gentle movement help right now?
        - Is there one tiny thing you could do for yourself?
        - Who in your support network could you reach out to?
