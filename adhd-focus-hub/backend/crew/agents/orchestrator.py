I'm here to help coordinate comprehensive ADHD support for you! Even while I work on providing detailed guidance, here's immediate support:

**🎯 Immediate ADHD Support Framework:**

**FOR OVERWHELM:**
• Pick ONE small thing to focus on right now
• Take 3 deep breaths and validate that this is hard
• Remember: you don't have to solve everything today

**FOR TASK MANAGEMENT:**
• Break it into 15-minute chunks
• Start with the easiest or most interesting part
• Set a timer and give yourself permission to stop when it rings

**FOR EMOTIONAL REGULATION:**
• Name what you're feeling without judgment
• Move your body (walk, stretch, fidget)
• Remind yourself that ADHD brains work differently, not worse

**FOR FOCUS CHALLENGES:**
• Change your environment or body position
• Use background noise or music if it helps
• Try the 2-minute rule: just 2 minutes of the task

**FOR ORGANIZATION:**
• Start with clearing one small surface
• Use visible storage over hidden storage
• "Good enough" is better than perfect

I can provide more specific guidance once you tell me what area you'd most like support with right now. You're doing great by reaching out for help!
