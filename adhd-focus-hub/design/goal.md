# My Understanding of Your Goal

- Core Idea: Create a system that acts like an intelligent companion—observing, learning, and adapting to your unique personality, habits, routines, and challenges. It should provide proactive, personalized support for better life management (e.g., productivity, well-being, goal achievement).
- ADHD Tie-In: While we’re building the system first, we’ll ensure it’s optimized for ADHD traits (e.g., handling executive function, motivation dips, or sensory overload) once we incorporate those details. This keeps us aligned with the Space’s focus.
- Generalizability: Design it modularly so it could be adapted for others—perhaps as an open framework where users input their profiles, and the system generates tailored plans.
- Efficiency via AI Agents: a team of specialized agents to “debate” and build the system collaboratively. This simulates a think tank, allowing us to iterate quickly without me having to micromanage.
