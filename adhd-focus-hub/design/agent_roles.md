- Agent Framework Idea: I could create a “team” of 3-5 specialized agents (simulated within my responses) that discuss key components:
  - Planning Agent: Focuses on task management and routines.
  - Motivation Agent: Handles rewards, accountability, and emotional hurdles.
  - Tracking Agent: Monitors progress and suggests adjustments.
  - Integration Agent: Ensures everything fits together holistically.
  - They would “debate” options (e.g., “Planning Agent: A Pomodoro timer might help with focus. Motivation Agent: But add gamification to make it engaging.”) to arrive at optimized recommendations.
