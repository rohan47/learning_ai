# System Pipeline Overview

Here’s a high-level pipeline of your personalized life optimization (and ADHD management) system. This pipeline reflects a modular, AI-driven architecture designed for adaptability and generalization.

1. Input & Data Collection
   - User Profiling
   - Conversational intake (questions, reflections)
   - Personality, goals, and preferences survey
   - Import or sync with existing tools (calendar, to-do lists, fitness apps, etc.)
   - Habit & Routine Tracking
   - Daily/weekly routines (input or app integrations)
   - Self-reports (quick check-ins, energy/mood logs)
   - Passive data (optional; e.g., device usage stats)
2. Analysis & Understanding
   - Pattern Discovery
   - AI agents collaborate to analyze routines, habits, and behavior patterns
   - Identification of strengths, friction points, and environmental factors
   - Profile Enrichment
   - Dynamic user model updates based on new insights
   - Contextual understanding (e.g., energy peaks, preferred reward types)
3. Strategy Generation
   - Personalized Recommendations
   - Action plans tailored to current habits, preferences, and goals
   - Suggestions for habit stacking, routine tweaks, or time-blocking
   - Automation & Nudges
   - Smart reminders (timed to fit your patterns)
   - Adaptive feedback—system learns and adjusts based on user input
4. Output & Interaction
   - Personal Assistant Interface
   - Chat-based guidance (ongoing conversation)
   - Dashboards (summaries, progress, upcoming tasks)
   - Regular reports (daily/weekly reviews)
   - User Feedback Loop
   - Quick feedback after actions (“Did this work for you?”)
   - Reflection prompts (reinforcing learning and system adjustment)
5. Adaptation & Learning
   - Continual Learning
   - AI agents discuss outcomes, update approaches, and suggest improvements
   - System refines user profile and strategies over time
   - Generalization Module
   - (Future) Export anonymized templates for others
   - Ability to share successful workflows and best practices
